REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED PACKAGES:
prerequisites:
Storable;            #in base perl distro as of 5.6.1 (or earlier)
Digest::MD5;         #in the future, Digest::SHA1, etc. could be used
                     #for a marginal decrease in collisions at a speed
                     #cost - eventually this will be a conf file option
ExtUtils::MakeMaker; #only needed for build process, can be removed after

recommended:
Fcntl                #increases logging speed by a factor of ~30

optional (depends on your usage):
DBI, XML::Comma, HTML::Mason
	presence of these modules activates the appropriate helper modules
	when you "use Cache::Static;"

if you are happy to let Makefile.PL auto-detect extensions and wrappers:
	perl Makefile.PL ; make ; make test && $SUDO make install

otherwise, specify any extensions/wrappers you want to exclude on the
Makefile.PL command line, e.g. to exclude HTML::Mason support:
	perl Makefile.PL -HTML::Mason

Note you can also disable hmc, which is an HTML::Mason::Compiler that
tries to determine what physical files HTML::Mason relies on.
You probably want to exclude this functionality by passing -hmc if
you have overridden any HTML::Mason classes. Note that this leaves
HTML_Mason_Util::cache_it availble:
	perl Makefile.PL -hmc
