Revision history for Perl extension Cache::Static.

-----------------------------
0.98  2006/08/19 12:56:06 GMT
-----------------------------

- add (stubbed) docs & otherwise prepare for CPAN

-----------------------------
0.97  2006/08/11 20:31:58 GMT
-----------------------------

- more flexible dependency enabling/disabling system in Makefile.PL
  (used for compatibility with Gadgets)

-----------------------------
0.96  2006/04/20 01:30:48 GMT
-----------------------------

- introduced cache-static-cleanup.pl for cleaning old cruft
- fix a bug with hmc getting the parent directory of a subcomponent wrong
- fix a bug that was preventing setting log_level in top level config
- some cleanup
- per-namespace configs are inherited with namespace arguments
- attempt to use illegal namespaces (ie, config, log, timestamps)
  is caught

-----------------------------
0.95  2006/01/17 16:05:58 GMT
-----------------------------

- extraneous/duplicate log message cleanup
- allow directories to disappear from underneath us (call _mkdir_p more)
- recursed components are now cached for top level deps
- set, get_if_same, (and _get, _is_same) allow overriding namespace 
  from init() e.g.:
    function(... args ...) => function(... args ..., namespace => $ns)
- all directories created under $ROOT now default to mode 777,
  and all files created are chmod'd to mode 666
  this makes things work, but is not the right way, long term...
- init() now re-loads global AND per-namespace configs
- added support for namespaces, per-namespace configs
- stopped overloading .dep files. timestamp files (for extensions)
  are now in $ROOT/timestamps, with a .ts extension - note carefully
  that these are NOT namespace dependent, so an update is global, as
  they would be with a modification of a depended file.
- move .dep files back into cache/ dir with .dep extension
  (saves excess directories, easier to navigate)
- md5_path() no longer translates '+' to '-', this works around a
  display bug in ffox with HTML_Mason_Util::cache_it(), where e.g.
    <!-- serving cached component a/b/c/d--z -->
  would be displayed as is on the page. while strictly speaking, this
  was invalid, the ffox developers are silly not to "fix" this... all
  components with - in the name now will have + in place:
    <!-- serving cached component a/b/c/d++z -->
- extra depends from a HTML::Mason subcomponent are now recursed and 
  searched for dependencies therein, etc.

-----------------------------
0.94  2006/01/15 07:07:36 GMT
-----------------------------

- added rudimentary support for automagically adding file dependencies
  on HTML::Mason subcomponents, e.g:
    <%init>
    return if Cache::Static::HTML_Mason_Util::cache_it(
       $r, $m, 1, [ ]);
    </%init>
    <& foo &>
  automatically adds a dependency on the file foo (as well as the file
  of the master component). Notes on this feature:
		- <& foo &> - detected
		- <& 'foo' &> - detected
		- <& "foo" &> - detected
		- <& "f${some_var_expanding_to_o}o" &> - NOT detected, never will be
		- <& $foo &> - NOT detected, never will be
		- <& pack("lll",(102,111,111)) &> - NOT detected, never will be
		- <&| foo &>some content</&> - NOT supported, might be later
		- code is unoptimized (will be later)
		- code does not recurse to find depends (will later)
		- code isn't configurable (will be later)
- added HIT and MISS deps
- fixed dep.ts file saving
- doc fix for HTML_Mason_Util - use:
    return if Cache::Static::HTML_Mason_Util::cache_it
  (return instead of exit)
- logging function 35 times faster by avoiding exec'ing echo

-----------------------------
0.93  2006/01/02 04:52:19 GMT
-----------------------------

- allow for different return values if a given dependency is in an 
	unknown state (e.g. a file dependency is not found):
		'file-0|/tmp/foo' #if ! -e /tmp/foo, regenerate
		'file-1|/tmp/foo' #if ! -e /tmp/foo, serve
		'file|/tmp/foo'   #use the config value "dep_file_not_found_returns"
- added configuration file and implemented its 4 options:
	log_level [ 0..4 ]
	dep_file_not_found_returns [ BINARY ]
	unrecognized_dependency_returns [ BINARY ]
	recursive_unlink [ BINARY ]
- dependency timestamp files in dep.ts/ record the plain text dep in the file
- logging improved significantly
- extension interface improved/cleaned a bit
- seperation of cache/ and dep.ts/ directories
- build process cleaned up

-----------------------------
0.92  2005/12/30 10:17:48 GMT
-----------------------------

- initial support for DBI dependencies (by database and table)
- a few sundry small fixes

-----------------------------
0.91  2005/12/13 20:32:10 GMT
-----------------------------

- Cache::Static::HTML_Mason_Util cleanup:
	- "dhandler_mode" deprecated (now auto-detected)
	- dependency auto-addition for subcomponents fixed

-----------------------------
0.90  2005/12/13  3:05:37 GMT
-----------------------------

- initial release
